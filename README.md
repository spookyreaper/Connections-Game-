# Connections-Game-

## Description

Players must find groups of four words that have a common topic in the interactive online game Connections Game. Finding every connection while avoiding more than four errors is the aim. A visually assist and a sense of accomplishment are added when a color-coded banner exposes the category of connection after each correct guess.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## Steps Taken

-Determining the user flow and defining the fundamental game mechanics were the first steps in the development process. I made the game to be very simple to use, allowing users to drag and drop words and enter their responses with a few clicks.

-I put in place a scoring system and visual cues for right and wrong responses to increase user engagement. I handled the game logic and dynamically updated the game board using JavaScript arrays and DOM manipulation.

-One of the key features I focused on was the help box, which provides players with instructions and tips on how to play the game. I used a modal-style overlay for the help box to ensure players could access the information without leaving the game context.
